Base repository to demonstrate the process of uploading an [`aar`](https://sites.google.com/a/android.com/tools/tech-docs/new-build-system/aar-format)/[`jar`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) to [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/).

**Blog Post :** [Guide to publishing your Android Library via JitPack](http://crushingcode.co/publish-your-android-library-via-jitpack/) 

The process is as follows

1. Create an Android project or open an existing one in [Android Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio)

1. Init the project with git and also create a repo on Github for the same. Each step here onwards represent a commit and should be pushed to github.

1. Create and add a new module and choose `Android Library`.
   > Goto `File>New>New Module..` and select `Android Library`.

1. Implement your library code inside the library module you created in the last step.

1. Next add the library module as a dependency to the app module.
   > 1. Goto `File>Project Structure..`
   > 1. Select `app` module in the sidebar
   > 1. Select the `Dependencies` tab
   > 1. At the bottom is a `+` icon, click that and select `Module dependency` and select your `library` module.
   > 1. Press `apply` or `ok`.

1. Once project is synced, add the android-maven-gradle-plugin to classpath in build.gradle file at root project level.
  ```gradle
   dependencies {
      classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.1.2'
      ..
      ..
      // Setup the android-maven-gradle-plugin in the classpath
      classpath 'com.github.dcendents:android-maven-gradle-plugin:1.3'
      ..
  ```

1. Next, apply the android-maven-gradle-plugin to the build.gradle file at library module level. Also add the group variable.
  ```gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.android.library'

   // Required plugin in library module
   apply plugin: 'com.github.dcendents.android-maven'

   // Replace nisrulz with <your_github_username>
   group='com.github.nisrulz'
  ```  

1. Create a release TAG in git
  ```
  git tag -a 1.0 -m "v1.0"
  git push origin 1.0
  ```

1. Once everything is pushed and the release TAG is also pushed, goto `https://www.jitpack.io/#username/reponame` where replace `username` with your github username and `reponame` with the reponame of the android project.

1. Select the release you would like to share by clicking the ‘Get It’ button next to the list of releases of your repository.

1. Next the same page at Jitpack would show you how to use the library in your other android projects. Something like below

  Selectable code

  ```gradle
  repositories {
      jcenter()
      maven { url “https://jitpack.io” }
  }
  dependencies {
      compile 'com.github.nisrulz:awesomelib:1.0'
  }
  ```

1. Let the world know of your **AwesomeLib** :smile:
  > + Add a readme that explains how to integrate and use your Awesome library
  > + Add a license block as in this repo
  > + Also include the JitPack badge provided by jitpack in your readme
  > + Promote your lib on social media so that others can know about it.
  > + Always add a working sample app in your project that demonstrates your library in use.
  > + Add screenshots if possible in your readme.
